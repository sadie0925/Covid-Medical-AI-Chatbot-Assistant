Larger droplets may fall to the ground in a few seconds, but tiny infectious particles can linger in the air and accumulate in indoor places, especially where many people are gathered and there is poor ventilation. This is why mask-wearing, hand hygiene and physical distancing are essential to preventing COVID-19.",
          "SARS-CoV-2 spreads from person to person through close communities. When people with COVID-19 breathe out or cough, they expel tiny droplets that contain the virus. These droplets can enter the mouth or nose of someone without the virus, causing an infection to occur. The most common way that this illness spreads is through close contact with someone who has the infection. Close contact is within around 6 feet. Droplets containing the virus can also land on nearby surfaces or objects. Other people can pick up the virus by touching these surfaces or objects. Infection is likely if the person then touches their nose, eyes, or mouth. It is important to note that COVID-19 is new, and research is still ongoing. There may also be other ways that the new coronavirus can spread.",

The virus can spread from an infected person’s mouth or nose in small liquid particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe. Another person can then contract the virus when infectious particles that pass through the air are inhaled at short range (this is often called short-range aerosol or short-range airborne transmission) or if infectious particles come into direct contact with the eyes, nose, or mouth (droplet transmission).",

Talk to the provider if you have any questions about treatments. Help the sick person get food and any medication needed. And, if needed, take care of the person's pet. Carefully watch yourself or your loved one for signs and symptoms that are getting worse. The health care provider might suggest use of a home pulse oximeter, especially if the sick person has risk factors for severe illness with COVID-19 and COVID-19 symptoms. A pulse oximeter is a plastic clip that attaches to a finger. The device can help check breathing by measuring how much oxygen is in the blood. A reading of less than 92% might increase the need for staying in the hospital. If the provider recommends a pulse oximeter, make sure you understand how to use the device properly. And make sure you know when a reading should prompt a call to the provider. If symptoms seem to be getting worse, call the provider.",
